= Ruby AGI
Copyright (C) 2007 Hans Fugal <mailto:hans@fugal.net>.
Distributed under the same terms as Ruby.

== Synopsis

In extensions.conf:

    exten => monkeys,1,AGI(monkeys.agi)

monkeys.agi:

    #!/usr/bin/ruby
    require 'agi'

    agi = AGI.new
    agi.answer
    agi.stream_file('tt-monkeysintro', nil)
    begin
      r = agi.stream_file('tt-monkeys', '#') # press pound to make them stop!
    end whlie r.result != ?#

== Requirements
All you need is Ruby. Ruby's all you need. You might want Asterisk too.

== Installation
    sudo rake install
or
    sudo ruby setup.rb

== Details
An AGI object serves as your proxy to Asterisk. Each time you send a command to
Asterisk using AGI#send or using the metaprogrammed interface, you get an
AGI::Response back. 

== TODO
- 5xx errors span multiple lines and should be handled by the lib (probably an
  exception raised too)
- It might be nice to have convenience methods that match up with regular
  Asterisk Applications (commands), e.g. Playback, Background, etc. 
- I'm inclined to make an OpenStruct-like interface to the Asterisk
  environment, but I need to make sure there won't be any metaprogramming
  conflitcs
